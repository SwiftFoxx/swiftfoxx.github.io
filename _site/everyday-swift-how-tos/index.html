<p class="quote">The job of a developer or an engineer is not to write code. The job is to solve problems.</p>

<p>SwiftUI is designed to be expressive, concise, and closely aligned with how UI is described. Most day-to-day development involves small, practical decisions: <em>layout adjustments, view visibility, styling, previews, and adapting to system appearance</em>.</p>

<p>This section brings together a set of <strong>focused how-to articles</strong> that address common SwiftUI tasks developers encounter while building real apps. Each post is scoped to a single problem and shows the most direct, idiomatic way to solve it using SwiftUI.</p>

<p>The topics here intentionally stay at the surface level:<br /></p>

<p>Centering views, applying padding selectively, reacting to color scheme changes, styling buttons, working with SF Symbols, and using previews effectively. These are not advanced concepts, but they are patterns you use constantly.</p>

<p>These articles act as practical references that you can read, code along, and refer to later.</p>

<p>This collection serves as a foundation for everything that follows—simple, repeatable solutions that keep SwiftUI layouts predictable, consistent, and aligned with system behavior.</p>
