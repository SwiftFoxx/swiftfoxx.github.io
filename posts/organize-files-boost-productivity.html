        <h1>Organize Your Files To Boost Productivity</h1>
        <p>
            Organizing your files in a specific structure is important not only because it <i>"looks"</i> good, but also
            because it can speed up your development, improve how you code, and even decrease build and compile time.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's debatable which one is the best structure for files and folders that never seems to reach any
            conclusion. But it's imparative to arrange those things in ways that seems beneficial for the project's
            requirements and the architecture that's being maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's explore <b>how to organize files</b>, <b>why each structure exists</b>, and <b>when to use which
                architecture</b>—with concrete, and real-world examples.
        </p>

        <h2>Why File Organization Matters More Than You Think</h2>
        <p>
            In Swift projects, file organization directly affects <i>navigation speed in Xcode</i>, <i>architectural
                discipline</i>, <i>mental context switching</i>, <i>merge conflicts</i>, <i>compile-time clarity</i>.
            <br>
            While a good structure mirrors how you think about the app, enforces boundaries naturally, grows linearly
            with complexity, a bad structure encourages massive files, hides dependencies, couples unrelated features,
            makes refactors painful.

            Files should be grouped by why they exist, not what they are.
