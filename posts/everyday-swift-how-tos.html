            The job of a developer or an engineer is not to write code. The job is to solve problems.

            SwiftUI is designed to be expressive, concise, and closely aligned with how UI is described. Most day-to-day
            development involves small, practical decisions: <i>layout adjustments, view visibility, styling, previews,
                and
                adapting to system appearance</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            This section brings together a set of <b>focused how-to articles</b> that address common SwiftUI tasks
            developers encounter while building real apps. Each post is scoped to a single problem and shows the most
            direct, idiomatic way to solve it using SwiftUI.
        </p>

        <p>
            The topics here intentionally stay at the surface level:<br>
            centering views, applying padding selectively, reacting to color scheme changes, styling buttons, working
            with SF Symbols, and using previews effectively. These are not advanced concepts, but they are patterns you
            use constantly.
        </p>

        <p>
            These articles act as practical references that you can read, code along, and refer to later.
        </p>

        <p>
            This collection serves as a foundation for everything that follows—simple, repeatable solutions that keep
            SwiftUI layouts predictable, consistent, and aligned with system behavior.

                <p>Organizing folders and fies are important architectural decisions. Depending on the structure – MVC,
                    MVVM, VIPER etc. – the file-folder structure changes. Just make sure it aids you more than it hurts

                <p>In 2026, we can't engineer an app without reusability. It's scalable, customizable and saves a lot of
                    time. But how many ways can we make something reusable?</p>

                    Apple gives us and it takes ages to figure out the whats and hows. Let's get into buttons and
